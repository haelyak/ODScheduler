For instance R1 would represent the rest period on the first day of the session. If a given day does not have a rest period, for instance day 7 might be a trip day and only have a night period, you would skip R7 in the list and input N7 only. Similarily, if a night is an ALL-ON night, you would skip that night in the list.\n",

For instance if counselor A1 is off on day 3 and day 10 in the session, the dictionary would contain \"Counselor A1\" : [3, 10].
